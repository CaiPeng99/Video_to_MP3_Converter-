# Video_to_MP3_Converter-
A microservice project to conver video to mp3
=======
Hi, there!
Here is a project using a Micro-service system design idea. The tech stacks included are Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, MongoDB,
and it uses Python. 
I'm a big fan of Python, lol. 

This project demonstrates building a scalable microservices architecture using Python and Kubernetes.
It aims to convert the video file to an mp3 file. 
the whole architecture looks like this:

      Key features include:
         MongoDB: 
            Implemented as a SQL database for scalable data storage.
         Docker:
            Containerized applications for consistent environments and easy deployment.
         Kubernetes: 
            Managed container orchestration, ensuring efficient scaling and deployment.
         RabbitMQ: 
            Implemented for reliable messaging and communication between microservices.
         CI/CD Integration: 
           Implemented continuous integration and deployment pipelines to streamline updates.
         Monitoring and Logging: 
            Set up robust monitoring and logging to maintain high availability and troubleshoot effectively.


JWT looks like:
